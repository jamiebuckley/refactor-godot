            <description>Mine 5 coal in a day, with 1 worker</description>
            <fullInfo>
                Unfortunately, four of yesterday's workers have come down with some form of coal-dust-induced coughing fit, and only Bob has showed up for duty today.
                Way to go Bob!  Now seems a good time to demonstrate that one worker can easily do the work of five with nothing but a bit of elbow grease and emotional manipulation.
                Get to it Bob!
